# Personas and Pathways

Here we define potential users and contributers and how they can fit
into this project. For further information we would like to refer to
this [document which explains the purpose of
personas](https://mozillascience.github.io/working-open-workshop/personas_pathways/).

## Users

### Ida (lecturer)

Ida is a researcher in life sciences working on fruit fly
genetics. For several years, she has been an active member of the Open Science
community. Besides that, she like modern art,
Jazz music, and tries to get into soldering in her local hack space.

She would like to teach an Open Science course but she knows
organising it from scratch requires a lot of work which
she cannot squeeze into her tight schedule. Ida searches the web for
potential material and finds **Open Science 101**. As this reduces the
preparation effort for her dramatically, she decides to offer the course
"Introduction to Open Science". After each lecture, she reports
back to the **Open Science 101** team and points out material that is
missing or in need of improvement.

### Nick (student)

Nick is a student of Physics and will soon start his Masters in
semi-conductor quantum mechanics. When talking to a PhD student during
an intership, he heard about problems in the current way science is
conducted. He was informed that there is an Open Science movement that
would like to change how science is performed and he got interested in
learnig how he could apply these principles to his research.

He finds Ida's course about Open Science at his university. Ida invites the participants of the course to give feedback to
the **Open Science 101** project. Nick creates a GitHub account and
raises several issues where he suggests how the material could be
improved.

### Natalia (citizen scientist / interested layperson)

Natalia works as a lawyer at a larger company. At some point she
recognized, inspired by books of Carl Sagan, how much fun
science and engineering can be. Due to this, she started her own small
science projects on her spare time. 

On Twitter, she stumbles accross a link to the **Open Science 101** project
and reads the material for the different topics. Based on this newly
aquired knowledge, she makes her small project open and connects it to the
Open Science community by joining the OKFN Open Science mailing
list. Some months later, she gives a lightning talk about Open Science
at a maker fair in her town. She uses some graphics and material taken
from the **Open Science 101** project. While preparing, she spots a typo in
the material and writes an email to the maintainer of the material.
